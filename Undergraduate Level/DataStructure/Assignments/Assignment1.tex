\title{\Large \bf
Assignment I: Library Management System}


\begin{document}

\noindent
\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{ p{3cm}  l}
\textbf{Student Name:} & \makebox[6cm]{\hrulefill} \\ % Write your name here
\textbf{Student ID:} & \makebox[6cm]{\hrulefill} \\ % Write your student ID here
\end{tabular*}

\begin{instructions}

    You are required to implement a simple Library Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in C++.

    Your program should:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Define classes for \textbf{Book}, \textbf{Member}, and \textbf{Library}.
        \item Allow adding new books and members to the library.
        \item Implement functionality for borrowing and returning books.
        \item Ensure that a book cannot be borrowed if it is already checked out.
        \item Display the list of available books and the borrowing status.
        \item Use appropriate methods and attributes for each class.
        \item Demonstrate encapsulation, inheritance (if applicable), and other OOP concepts.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Submission Requirements:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Include your well-commented source code in the report.
        \item Provide sample test cases and their outputs.
        \item Briefly explain your design choices and how OOP principles are applied.
        \item Ensure your code is well-structured and follows best practices.

    \end{itemize}

\section{Introduction}
This document illustrates how to use the provided LaTeX class and environments for your programming assignment submissions. Use the \texttt{codelisting} environment for your code, and the \texttt{testcase} environment for worked examples.

\section{Sample Code Listing}
Below is an example of how to include C++ code in your report:

\begin{codelisting}
// Example: Hello World in C++
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    cout << "Hello, world!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
\end{codelisting}

\section{Test Cases}
Here are some sample test cases you can include in your report:
\begin{testcase}[Swapping Two Numbers in C++]
\begin{codelisting}
int a = 5, b = 10;
swap(a, b);
cout << "a = " << a << ", b = " << b << endl;
\end{codelisting   }

Output:
\begin{codelisting}
a = 10, b = 5
\end{codelisting}
\end{testcase}

\section{Inserting Figures}
You can include figures in your report using the \texttt{figure} environment. Here is an example:   
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{ImageSample.png} % Replace with your image file
    \caption{Sample Image}
    \label{fig:sample-figure}
\end{figure}
